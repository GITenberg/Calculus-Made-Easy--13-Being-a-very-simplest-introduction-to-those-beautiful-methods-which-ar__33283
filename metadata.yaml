description: "Calculus Made Easy is a book on infinitesimal calculus originally published\
  \ in 1910 by Silvanus P. Thompson. The original text continues to be available as\
  \ of 2008 from Macmillan and Co., but a 1998 update by Martin Gardner is available\
  \ from St. Martin's Press which provides an introduction; three preliminary chapters\
  \ explaining functions, limits, and derivatives; an appendix of recreational calculus\
  \ problems; and notes for modern readers. Gardner changes \"fifth form boys\" to\
  \ the more American sounding (and gender neutral) \"high school students,\" updates\
  \ many now obsolescent mathematical notations or terms, and uses American decimal\
  \ dollars and cents in currency examples.\nCalculus Made Easy ignores the use of\
  \ limits with its epsilon-delta definition, replacing it with a method of approximating\
  \ (to arbitrary precision) directly to the correct answer in the infinitesimal spirit\
  \ of Leibniz, now formally justified in modern non-standard analysis and smooth\
  \ infinitesimal analysis.\nThe original text is now in the public domain under US\
  \ copyright law (although Macmillan's copyright under UK law is reproduced in the\
  \ 2008 edition from St. Martin's Press). It can be freely accessed on Project Gutenberg.\n\
